# WordCount
Counts the number of occurrences for each word in a file downloaded from a given URL.

## Setup
A cloudformation template is provided (LambdaCloudFormation.yaml) that can be uploaded to CloudFormation to create a
stack with a Lambda function.  There are 3 parameters for the template, the S3 bucket and key parameters are defaulted
in case it is desired to use the artifacts available in the public accessible buckets.

## Running
Once Cloudformation creates the Lambda function, you can execute the function by navigating to the Lambda function in the AWS Console.
From there click on the created function and select the 'Test' tab.
For the 'Events Json' section at the bottom, erase all content and replace with the URL of some link you wish to
execute the function on to count the words from, ensuring double quotes are around the value.
